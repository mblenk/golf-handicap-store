# HANDICAP STORE

This is a MERN stack application designed to allow users to input their golf scores and calculate their handicap index. 

Using JWT authentication, users can then store their scores and receive an updated handicap with each new entry.

### Background

This project is a continuation/upgrade to a previous project using Vanilla JS that can be accessed from the landing page. The repo for this project can be accessed here: [golf-handicap-calculator](https://github.com/mblenk/golf-handicap-calculator).

The original project was a one-time calculation tool that would take in up to 20 scores and calculate a handicap based on this data. I wanted to take this to the next step and implement backend functionality that would allow a user to store their scores and update their handicap periodically.
